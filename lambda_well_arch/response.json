{"statusCode": 200, "headers": {"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"}, "body": "{\"response\": \"**Summary**: The best practices across Prepare, Operate, and Evolve phases from the Operational Excellence Pillar for serverless architectures in AWS include automation of testing and rollback processes, documentation and sharing of design standards, and encouragement of development and testing environments with increasing levels of operational controls.\\n\\n**Details**:\\n\\n*The Prepare phase*\\nIn the Prepare phase, it is essential to conduct architecture designs with operational excellence in mind. This involves continuous iteration and learning from anomalies or failures. The goal is to make architectural changes with the customer and operational excellence in mind. Additionally, updates to design standards should be shared across teams and versions should be manageable.\\n\\n*Key Points:*\\n\\n* Architecture designs should be made with operational excellence in mind.\\n* Continuous iteration and learning from anomalies or failures are emphasized.\\n* Architecture updates and version management are crucial.\\n\\n*The Operate phase*\\nDuring the Operate phase, organizations should establish proactive monitoring and metrics analysis, along with a clear issue management process. This includes Detailed Error Event analysis, ML analytics, and cloud-based monitoring in the development and test environments. The objective is to track the temperature of the operational metrics defined in the baseline threat model and identify deviations.\\n\\n*Key Points:*\\n\\n* Monitoring, tracking, and issuing management are key in maintaining operational excellence in serverless architectures.\\n\\n*The Evolve phase*\\nIn the Evolve phase, planning and executing operations improvement is crucial. This involves increasing the predictability and accuracy of operations, reducing manual configurations, and aligning with team responsibilities. Several management and operation tools, such as AWS Systems Manager, AWS Config, and Patch Manager, can help automate and optimize operations.\\n\\n*Key Points:*\\n\\n* Workload configuration should be simplified and made less error-prone.\\n* Automated operations with management and operation tools are highly recommended.\\n* Continuous improvement and experimentation should be encouraged for better adaptability.\\n\\n**Source Insight**: These best practices are outlined in the Operational Excellence Pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which provides prescriptive guidance on implementation for building workload the right way and delivering a great customer experience. The framework emphasizes the importance of continuous iteration, sharing design standards, and the use of management and operation tools for efficient and effective serverless architecture governance.\", \"sources\": [\"wafr/wellarchitected-framework.pdf\", \"wafr/wellarchitected-framework.pdf\", \"wafr/wellarchitected-framework.pdf\"]}"}
